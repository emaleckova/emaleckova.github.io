Try for a goal that’s reasonable, and then gradually raise it.\nEmil Zátopek\n\nRunning brings so many learnings - from goal settings to working towards them, it trains not only the physical skills but also endurance and patience. It is a process and an enjoyable way.\nThe science of running is no less interesting. We - humans - have basically evolved to run. The adaptation on the foot include longitudinal arch and the Achilles tendon which help with energy storage and release while running. An anatomical structure unique to humans is the nuchal ligament which prevents heads from tipping forward.\nWe differentiate from animals in our ability to maintain moderate speeds for long durations. A key adaptation in this regard is our sweating ability which is much more efficient than thermoregulation of most animals relying on panting. These adaptations make us to endurance runners."

    "section": "{optparse}",
    "text": "{optparse}\n\nAbout\nIt is a CRAN package also available from GitHub. It is not the only option for R users and apparently the {argparse} has some options. However, it comes at cost of more dependencies, including Python. Since the project I am currently working on has become quite complex and I am trying to keep the tech stack limited (mainly because of deplyoment reasons), I opted for {optparse}. It did not disappoint! The usage is very straightforward but still with quite some customization options - for example, a user-defined character in place for the option argument, which is a nice detail for the help page.\nWhile the README on GitHub is good enough to get first functional parser within minutes, I decided to provide a more detailed example use case in this post.\n\n\nA toy script\nWe will start by creating a small script. Since I spend most of my time with {ggplot2}, it will be a code to create a simple dot plot with mtcars dataset, one of the basic and well-known R datasets (comes from {datasets} package).\nAfter getting input data\n\ncars_dat &lt;- mtcars\n\nwe can create the simplest version of a ggplot2 code, where all values are hard-coded (such as the variables on x and y axes) or we rely on defaults (axis titles).\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nggplot(cars_dat, aes(x = mpg, y = hp)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = \"white\", fill = \"#26677FFF\", size = 3.5, alpha = 0.75, stroke = 1.5) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        aspect.ratio = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome flexibility with variables\nHowever, we can easily pass values stored in variables as in the examples with x and y variables below:\n\nx_var &lt;- \"mpg\"\ny_var &lt;- \"hp\"\n\nggplot(cars_dat, aes(x = !!sym(x_var), y = !!sym(y_var))) +\n  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = \"white\", fill = \"#26677FFF\", size = 3.5, alpha = 0.75, stroke = 1.5) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        aspect.ratio = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassing variables namse with sym()\n\n\n\n{ggplot2} is known to many and thus a good toy example. However, passing variables to aes() is a bit tricky. The aes() function expects symbols - i.e. unquoted variables (column names). We use sym() to convert character to a symbol which {ggplo2} can understand. It work in combination with Bang-Bang operator !! (“unquote”), which tells R to evaluate the expression.\n\n\n\n\nA parser example\nAbove, we passed variables to x and y in the aes() call, but the underlying values are still part of the code. If we want to plot relationship between another pair of variables, we still need to modify the actual code which as not as flexible as providing arguments from the command line, especially we want to share the script with others, who may not be so confident with programming. Here, comes the {optparse} package in play.\nWith the package loaded,\n\nlibrary(optparse)\n\nonly four steps are needed to make our script ready to accept options/arguments from command line:\n\nCreate parsesr with OptionParser\n\nSpecify its options with one or more add_option() function calls\n\nAccess the specified options with parse_args()\n\nUse the options/arguments in code as needed with $ operator\n\nA minimum functional example of the above four points follows:\n\n# 1. Create parser\n# ----------------\nopt_parser &lt;- OptionParser()\n\n# 2. Specify options\n# ------------------\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-v\", \"--verbose\"), action=\"store_true\",\n                     default=TRUE, help=\"Print extra output [default]\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-q\", \"--quietly\"), action=\"store_false\",\n                     dest=\"verbose\", help=\"Print little output\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"--x-variable\"), type=\"character\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"--y-variable\"), type=\"character\")\n\n# 3. Get options\n# --------------\nopts = parse_args(opt_parser)\n\n\n# 4. Apply options in the ggplot call\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nxvar &lt;- sym(opts$`x-variable`)\nprint(paste(\"x-axis variable:\", xvar))\n\nyvar &lt;- sym(opts$`y-variable`)\nprint(paste(\"y-axis variable:\", yvar))\n\nggplot(cars_dat, aes(x = !!xvar, y = !!yvar)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = \"white\", fill = \"#26677FFF\", size = 3.5, alpha = 0.75, stroke = 1.5) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        aspect.ratio = 1)\n\n\n\nCustomization options\nLet’s start by providing more details about the script to the user (will be siplayed with -h or --help tag, during development, we can use optparse::print_help()). Besides program name we wish to be displayed in help, we can provide example usage command and secription:\n\nopt_parser &lt;- OptionParser(\n  usage = \"Usage: Rscript -e %prog [options]\",\n  prog = \"PlotCars.R\",\n  description = \"Creates a dot plot of `mtcars` dataset based on user-provided arguments\",\n  epilogue = \"Fingers crossed for a nice plot\"\n)\n\nWe can obviously not only expand the options user can provide, but we can also set default values and decide to store the user-provided value in the short flag of a given argument for easier access in the code.\nEach option must have a long version of flag (e.g., --verbose above or --x-variable in one of the newly added options). We can provide a hort version as well (e.g., -v or -x). With that, we (our target audience) have less typing to do when running the script from command line. Another benefit is that we can use the short flag to access the option’s values in our code. To do so, we have to set the dest parameter of add_function() to the short tag. With that we can access the value with e.g. x instead of x-variable, which would moreover require wrapping it in \\``\\ because of - in the long tag.\nmetavar is a handy argument for a bit more customization and potentially more guidience on the individual options.\nWithout a metavar argument, long flag is used by default in help. For this code\n\nadd_option(opt_parser, c(\"-f\", \"--format\"), type=\"character\", default = \"pdf\",\n                         help=\"Export format for the plot: png, jpeg or pdf; defaults to pdf\",\n                         dest = \"f\")\n\nthe help looks like this:\n    -f FORMAT, --format=FORMAT\n        Export format for the plot: png, jpeg or pdf; defaults to pdf\nWe can provide additional detail about the expected input e.g. with metavar=\"file extension\". Specifying an otpion as below\n\nadd_option(opt_parser, c(\"-f\", \"--format\"), type=\"character\", default = \"pdf\",\n                         help=\"Export format for the plot: png, jpeg or pdf; defaults to pdf\",\n                         dest = \"f\",\n                         metavar=\"file extension\")\n\nwill results in such help description:\n    -f FILE EXTENSION, --format=FILE EXTENSION\n        Export format for the plot: png, jpeg or pdf; defaults to pdf`\nIn the command-line version of our littleR script, we will give user the following options:\n\nvariables to be plotted on x and y axis\n\ncustom axis titles\n\ncustom basename of the exported file\nand format to export into\n\n\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-x\", \"--x-variable\"), type=\"character\",\n                     help=\"Variable on x-axis, one of 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp',\n                     'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb'\",\n                     dest = \"x\",\n                     metavar=\"x variable\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-y\", \"--y-variable\"), type=\"character\",\n                         help=\"Variable on y-axis, one of 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp',\n                     'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb'\",\n                     dest = \"y\",\n                     metavar=\"y variable\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"--x-title\"), type=\"character\",\n                         help=\"Custom title of the x-axis\",\n                     metavar=\"axis title\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"--y-title\"), type=\"character\",\n                         help=\"Custom title of the y-axis\",\n                         metavar=\"axis title\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-n\", \"--name\"), type=\"character\",\n                         help=\"File basename\",\n                         dest = \"n\",\n                         metavar=\"name\")\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-f\", \"--format\"), type=\"character\", default = \"pdf\",\n                         help=\"Export format for the plot: png, jpeg or pdf; defaults to pdf\",\n                         dest = \"f\",\n                         metavar=\"file extension\")\n\nWe can display the help for our script with optparse::print_help(opt_parser)\nUsage: Rscript -e PlotCars.R [options]\nCreates a dot plot of `mtcars` dataset based on user-provided arguments\n\nOptions:\n    -h, --help\n        Show this help message and exit\n\n    -v, --verbose\n        Print extra output [default]\n\n    -q, --quietly\n        Print little output\n\n    -x X VARIABLE, --x-variable=X VARIABLE\n        Variable on x-axis, one of 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp',\n                     'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb'\n\n    -y Y VARIABLE, --y-variable=Y VARIABLE\n        Variable on y-axis, one of 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp',\n                     'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb'\n\n    --x-title=AXIS TITLE\n        Custom title of the x-axis\n\n    --y-title=AXIS TITLE\n        Custom title of the y-axis\n\n    -n NAME, --name=NAME\n        File basename\n\n    -f FILE EXTENSION, --format=FILE EXTENSION\n        Export format for the plot: png, jpeg or pdf; defaults to pdf\n\nFingers crossed for a nice plot\n\nThis comes close to Python-style program help pages and easy to read. It should be an easy task for the target user to run the code.\nHowever, we need to ensure code functionality by accessing the options correctly first! This is how the small ggplot code can be transformed:\n\nxvar &lt;- sym(opts$x)\nprint(paste(\"x-axis variable:\", xvar))\n\nyvar &lt;- sym(opts$y)\nprint(paste(\"y-axis variable:\", xvar))\n\np &lt;- ggplot(cars_dat, aes(x = !!xvar, y = !!yvar)) +\n  geom_point(shape = 21, colour = \"white\", fill = \"#26677FFF\", size = 3.5, alpha = 0.75, stroke = 1.5) +\n  labs(x = opts$`x-title`,\n       y = opts$`y-title`) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(axis.text = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        axis.title = element_text(face = \"bold\"),\n        aspect.ratio = 1)\n\nIn addition, we added few lines of code to control the export of generated figures. For demonstaration purpose, the allowed output formats are limited to PNG, JPEG and PDF only, which we need to handle accordingly and give user a warning message if some other format would be selected.\n\nif(!opts$f %in% c(\"png\", \"jpeg\", \"pdf\")){\n  print(\"ERROR: Figures can be exported into PNG, JPEG or PDF only!\")\n}else{\n  ggsave(filename = paste0(opts$n, \".\", opts$f), device = opts$f)\n}\n\n\n\nRequired options\nBy default, all options are optional, which does not bother are so much in case of axis titles or export options. If missing, the default behaviour will not break execution of the code and will result in decent outcomes - namely, axis titles being set to variables names as in the input data, Rplot as a file’s basename and export to PDF.\nHowever, if the user does not provide x and y variables, we will leave them with the beloe error message and wondering what happended.\nError in `sym()`:\n! Can't convert `NULL` to a symbol.\nBacktrace:\n    ▆\n 1. └─rlang::sym(opts$x)\n 2.   └─rlang:::abort_coercion(x, \"a symbol\")\n 3.     └─rlang::abort(msg, call = call)\nExecution halted\nExplicitly specifying required arguments in the help is a good starting point - e.g.:\n\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-x\", \"--x-variable\"), type=\"character\",\n                     help=\"REQUIRED: Variable on x-axis, one of 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp',\n                     'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb'\",\n                     dest = \"x\",\n                     metavar=\"x variable\")\n\nopt_parser &lt;- add_option(opt_parser, c(\"-y\", \"--y-variable\"), type=\"character\",\n                     help=\"REQUIRED: Variable on x-axis, one of 'mpg', 'cyl', 'disp', 'hp',\n                     'drat', 'wt', 'qsec', 'vs', 'am', 'gear', 'carb'\",\n                     dest = \"y\",\n                     metavar=\"y variable\")\n\nHowever, performing a check for meaningful inputs in the code should be done for critical options.\n1. Check for non-NULL inputs\nIf an option is not provided a default value - e.g., as we have done with the export format default = \"pdf\" - it is automatically set to NULL when adding the option to the parser. We can take advantage of this and check that the mandatory parameters are not NULL.\n\n# Access optins\nopts = parse_args(opt_parser)\n\nif (is.null(opts$x)) {\n  stop(\"ERROR: -x/--x-variable is required\")\n}\nif (is.null(opts$y)) {\n  stop(\"ERROR: -y/--y-variable is required\")\n}\n\n# .... Plotting code here .....\n\n2. Custom validation function\nAlternatively, we can use a custom function to validate inputs before using them:\n\n# Create a validation function\nvalidate_required_args &lt;- function(opts) {\n  required_args &lt;- list(\n    x = \"-x/--x-variable\",\n    y = \"-y/--y-variable\"\n  )\n  \n  missing_args &lt;- character(0)\n  for (arg_name in names(required_args)) {\n    if (is.null(opts[[arg_name]])) {\n      missing_args &lt;- c(missing_args, required_args[[arg_name]])\n    }\n  }\n  \n  if (length(missing_args) &gt; 0) {\n    stop(\"Missing required arguments: \", paste(missing_args, collapse=\", \"))\n  }\n}\n\n# Access options\nopts &lt;- parse_args(opt_parser)\n# Use the validation function\nvalidate_required_args(opts)\n\n# .... Plotting code here .....\n\n\n\nRun R script from command line\nWith some checks implemented, we should have a fairly robust code to share with others. Before use, help can be displayed (obviously from directory where the script is located) with\nRscript PlotCars.R -h\nAn example usage may look like this:\nRscript PlotCars.R -x \"mpg\" -y \"wt\"\nor when using all available options like this:\nRscript PlotCars.R -x \"mpg\" -y \"wt\" --x-title \"Miles per gallon\" --y-title \"Weight [lb/1000]\"\n-n \"mpg_vs_wt\" -f \"png\"\n \n Want to try the script out?
