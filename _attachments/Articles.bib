    abstract = {Population surveys of Blumeria graminis f. sp. hordei (Bgh), a causal agent of more than 50% of barley fungal infections in the Czech Republic, have been traditionally based on virulence tests, at times supplemented with non-specific Restriction fragment length polymorphism or Random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. A genomic sequence of Bgh, which has become available recently, enables identification of potential markers suitable for population genetics studies. Two major strategies relying on transposable elements and microsatellites were employed in this work to develop a set of Repeat junction markers, Single sequence repeat and Single nucleotide polymorphism markers. A resolution power of the new panel of markers comprising 33 polymorphisms was demonstrated by a phylogenetic analysis of 158 Bgh isolates. A core set of 97 Czech isolates was compared to a set 50 Australian isolates on the background of 11 diverse isolates collected throughout the world. 73.2% of Czech isolates were found to be genetically unique. An extreme diversity of this collection was in strong contrast with the uniformity of the Australian one. This work paves the way for studies of population structure and dynamics based on genetic variability among different Bgh isolates originating from geographically limited regions.},

ABSTRACT={<sec><title>Introduction</title><p>Acute hemorrhage results in perfusion deficit and regional hypoxia. Since failure of intestinal integrity seem to be the linking element between hemorrhage, delayed multi organ failure, and mortality, it is crucial to maintain intestinal microcirculation in acute hemorrhage. During critical bleeding physicians increase FiO<sub>2</sub> to raise total blood oxygen content. Likewise, a systemic hypercapnia was reported to maintain microvascular oxygenation (μHbO<sub>2</sub>). Both, O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub>, may have adverse effects when applied systemically that might be prevented by local application. Therefore, we investigated the effects of local hyperoxia and hypercapnia on the gastric and oral microcirculation.</p></sec><sec><title>Methods</title><p>Six female foxhounds were anaesthetized, randomized into eight groups and tested in a cross-over design. The dogs received a local CO<sub>2</sub>-, O<sub>2</sub>-, or N<sub>2</sub>-administration to their oral and gastric mucosa. Hemorrhagic shock was induced through a withdrawal of 20% of estimated blood volume followed by retransfusion 60 min later. In control groups no shock was induced. Reflectance spectrophotometry and laser Doppler were performed at the gastric and oral surface. Oral microcirculation was visualized by incident dark field imaging. Systemic hemodynamic parameters were recorded continuously. Statistics were performed using a two-way-ANOVA for repeated measurements and <italic>post hoc</italic> analysis was conducted by Bonferroni testing (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05).</p></sec><sec><title>Results</title><p>The gastric μHbO<sub>2</sub> decreased from 76 ± 3% to 38 ± 4% during hemorrhage in normocapnic animals. Local hypercapnia ameliorated the decrease of μHbO<sub>2</sub> from 78 ± 4% to 51 ± 8%. Similarly, the oral μHbO<sub>2</sub> decreased from 81 ± 1% to 36 ± 4% under hemorrhagic conditions and was diminished by local hypercapnia (54 ± 4%). The oral microvascular flow quality but not the total microvascular blood flow was significantly improved by local hypercapnia. Local O<sub>2</sub>-application failed to change microvascular oxygenation, perfusion or flow quality. Neither CO<sub>2</sub> nor O<sub>2</sub> changed microcirculatory parameters and macrocirculatory hemodynamics under physiological conditions.</p></sec><sec><title>Discussion</title><p>Local hypercapnia improved microvascular oxygenation and was associated with a continuous blood flow in hypercapnic individuals undergoing hemorrhagic shock. Local O<sub>2</sub> application did not change microvascular oxygenation, perfusion and blood flow profiles in hemorrhage. Local gas application and change of microcirculation has no side effects on macrocirculatory parameters.</p></sec>}}

    abstract = {Although the Green Revolution in plant breeding led to increases in food production up until the early 2000s, the benefits of such traditional methods of crop improvement have reached a plateau. Targeted engineering approaches offer a promising solution toward enhancing crop yields in the post-Green Revolution era (Maurino and Weber, 2013; Batista-Silva et al., 2020). Attempts to improve crop yields by the genetic manipulation of photosynthesis have previously been directed toward modifying the biochemical reactions of photosynthesis, including the engineering of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (RuBisCO), the introduction of carbon concentrating mechanisms into C3 plants, and the creation of photorespiratory bypasses. The light reactions of photosynthesis have also been targeted by tweaking non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the cytochrome b6f complex, and by expanding the light absorption spectrum to capture more of the available light (summarized by Batista-Silva et al., 2020).},

Non-negative matrix factorization followed by k-means clustering identified an early CAM-specific cluster and a late one, which was specific for the early light phase. Enrichment analysis revealed abscisic acid metabolism, WRKY-regulated transcription, sugar and nutrient transport, and protein degradation in these clusters. Activation of the CAM pathway was supported by up-regulation of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase, cytosolic and chloroplastic malic enzymes, and several transport proteins, as well as by increased end-of-night titratable acidity and malate accumulation. The transcription factors HSFA2, NF-YA9, and JMJ27 were identified as candidate regulators of CAM induction. With this study we promote the model species T. triangulare, in which CAM can be induced in a controlled way, enabling further deciphering of CAM regulation.},

    abstract = {Plants must promptly recognize and respond to changing ambient conditions and attacking invaders. Major abiotic stresses adversely affecting crop production include, among others, drought, heat, and increased salinity. Biotic stress, imposed by fungal, bacterial, and viral pathogens, presents a comparable threat (Sharma et al., 2013; Deutsch et al., 2018; Godoy et al., 2021). Improving crop tolerance and resistance is the major task for the agriculture of the 21st century, which is greatly supported by establishment of gene modification techniques (Datta, 2013) and advancement of sequencing technologies (Niedringhaus et al., 2011). Nonetheless, quantitative evaluation of differences in stress responses between species or between a wild-type crop and a genetically modified line remains challenging.},

    abstract = {The majority of biotechnological production currently relies on heterotrophs—that is organisms dependent on carbohydrate feedstocks. Carbohydrate input not only accounts for a substantial proportion of the costs but is typically derived from valuable agricultural sources—such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) or maize (Zea mays)—thus increasing competition for these crops. Autotrophic microorganisms are promising alternatives; they generate their own carbohydrates and are structurally simpler and more photosynthetically efficient than plants (Zhu et al., 2008). Thanks to advances in molecular biology of cyanobacteria and synthetic biology in the past decades, strategies for using cyanobacteria as “carbon neutral” bioproduction hosts have been developed. Compounds that could be produced in these prokaryotic autotrophs range from biofuels, sugars, and sugar alcohols to isoprenoids, free fatty acids, plant secondary metabolites, and even valuable recombinant proteins (Al-Haj et al., 2016; Knoot et al., 2018).},

Extreme weather events, such as drought and heat waves, are expected to become increasingly common effects of climate change (Dai, 2013; Lesk et al., 2016). A detailed understanding of molecular mechanisms involved in drought responses is crucial to improve plant resilience to drought. The roles of abscisic acid (ABA) and soluble sugars in abiotic stress tolerance are well established, yet our knowledge of molecular mechanisms of starch catabolism under drought stress remains incomplete. },
